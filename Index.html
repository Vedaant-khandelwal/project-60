            <h3> <p>For me there cannot be a better pursuit than playing chess in my spare time. It not only keeps me busy but also gives entertainment, provides a welcome change and creative satisfaction. However, it is never an obsession with me. It best suits my aptitude and liking.

I was initiated into the game by my late father when I was just 6 years old. My father was a very good player of chess and would play it on Sundays and other holidays in the afternoon with his friend. It was really fascinating to see them get so absorbed in it that it made them forget everything around them. Their playing sessions would sometimes extend into late nights. Sometimes, when there was a power-failure or load-shedding, they would continue their game in candlelight. I learnt the finer points and strategies of the game by watching them play.</p>             </section>

Viswanathan Anand (born 11 December 1969) is an Indian chess grandmaster and former world chess champion. He became the first grandmaster from India in 1988, and is one of the few players to have surpassed an Elo rating of 2800, a feat he first achieved in 2006.[2]

Anand is a five-time world chess champion.[3] He defeated Alexei Shirov in a six-game match to win the 2000 FIDE World Chess Championship, a title he held until 2002. He later became the undisputed World Champion in 2007, and successfully defended his title against Vladimir Kramnik in 2008, Veselin Topalov in 2010, and Boris Gelfand in 2012.[4] In 2013, he lost the title to challenger Magnus Carlsen, and lost a rematch to Carlsen in 2014 after winning the 2014 Candidates Tournament.[5]

In April 2006, Anand became the fourth player in history to pass the 2800 Elo mark on the FIDE rating list, after Garry Kasparov, Vladimir Kramnik, and Veselin Topalov.[6] He occupied the number one position for 21 months, the sixth longest on record.

Known for his rapid playing speed as a child, Anand earned the sobriquet of "Lightning Kid"[7][8] during his early career in the 1980s. He has since developed into a universal player, and is considered by many to be the greatest rapid chess player of his generation.[9][10] He won the FIDE World Rapid Chess Championship in 2003 and 2017[11], the World Blitz Cup in 2000[12], and numerous other top-level rapid & blitz events.

Anand was the first recipient of the Rajiv Gandhi Khel Ratna Award in 1991–92, India's highest sporting honour. In 2007, he was awarded India's second highest civilian award, the Padma Vibhushan, making him the first sportsperson to receive the award.[13]

Early life
Viswanathan Anand was born on 11 December 1969 at Chennai, Tamil Nadu, India[14][15] where he grew up.[16] His father Krishnamurthy Viswanathan, a retired general manager of Southern Railways, had studied in Jamalpur, Bihar, and his mother Sushila was a housewife, chess aficionado and an influential socialite.[17]

Anand is the youngest of three children. He is 11 years younger than his sister and 13 years younger than his brother. His elder brother, Shivakumar, is a manager at Crompton Greaves in India and his elder sister, Anuradha, is a professor in the United States at the University of Michigan.[18][19]

Anand started learning chess from age six from his mother Sushila, but learned the intricacies of the game in Manila where he lived with his parents from 1978 up to the '80s while his father was contracted as a consultant by the Philippine National Railways.[20]

Anand was educated at Don Bosco Matriculation Higher Secondary School,[21] Egmore, Chennai and holds a degree of Bachelor of Commerce from Loyola College, Chennai.[22]

Personal life
Anand married Aruna in 1996 and has a son, Akhil, born on 9 April 2011, and is named in the traditional patronymic way Anand Akhil.[23]

In August 2010, Anand joined the board of directors of Olympic Gold Quest, a foundation for promoting and supporting India's elite sportspersons and potential young talent.[24][25][26] On 24 December 2010, Anand was the guest of honour on the grounds of Gujarat University, where 20,486 players created a new world record of simultaneous chess play at a single venue.[27]

His hobbies are reading, swimming, and listening to music.[20]

Anand has been regarded as an unassuming person with a reputation for refraining from political and psychological ploys and instead focusing on his game.[28] This has made him a well-liked figure throughout the chess world for two decades, evidenced by the fact that Garry Kasparov, Vladimir Kramnik, and Magnus Carlsen, of whom the first two were rivals for the World Championship throughout Anand's career, each aided him in his preparations for the World Chess Championship 2010.[29][30] Anand is sometimes known as the "Tiger of Madras".[31]

Anand was the only sportsperson to be invited to the dinner hosted by the Indian PM Manmohan Singh for US President Barack Obama on 7 November 2010.[32]

Anand was denied an honorary doctorate from University of Hyderabad because of confusion over his citizenship status; however, later Kapil Sibal, India's Minister of Human Resource Development apologised and said "There is no issue on the matter as Anand has agreed to accept the degree at a convenient time depending on his availability".[33] According to The Hindu, Anand finally declined to accept the doctorate.[34]

Endorsement
Anand is sponsored by NIIT[35] and Instaforex.[36]

Early chess career
Anand's rise in the Indian chess world was meteoric. National-level success came early for him when he won the national sub-junior championship with a score of 9/9 points in 1983, at the age of fourteen. In 1984 Anand won the Asian Junior Championship in Coimbatore earning a norm for the title International Master (IM) in the process. Soon afterwards, he participated in the 26th Chess Olympiad, held in Thessaloniki, where he made his debut in the Indian national team. There, Anand scored 7½ points from 11 games, gaining also his second IM norm.[37] He became the youngest Indian to achieve the title of International Master, at age 15, in 1985 by winning the Asian Junior Championship for the second year in a row, this time in Hong Kong.[38] At age 16, he became the national chess champion. He won that title two more times. He played games at blitz speed. In 1987, he became the first Indian to win the World Junior Chess Championship. In 1988, at age 18, he became India's first Grandmaster by winning the Shakti Finance International chess tournament held in Coimbatore, India. He was awarded Padma Shri at age 18.


Anand at the Manila 1992 Olympiad, age 22
In the World Chess Championship 1993 cycle, Anand qualified for his first Candidates Tournament, winning his first match but narrowly losing his quarter-final match to 1990 runner-up Anatoly Karpov.[39]

In 1994–95, Anand and Gata Kamsky dominated the qualifying cycles for the rival FIDE and PCA world championships. In the FIDE cycle (FIDE World Chess Championship 1996), Anand lost his quarter-final match to Kamsky after leading early.[40] Kamsky went on to lose the 1996 FIDE championship match against Karpov.

In the 1995 PCA cycle, Anand won matches against Oleg Romanishin and Michael Adams without a loss, then avenged his FIDE loss by defeating Gata Kamsky in the Candidates final.[41] In 1995, he played the PCA World Chess Championship 1995 against Kasparov in New York City's World Trade Center. After an opening run of eight draws (which was a record for the opening of a world championship match until 21 November 2018), Anand won game nine with a powerful exchange sacrifice, but then lost four of the next five. He lost the match 10½–7½.

In the 1998 FIDE cycle, the reigning champion Karpov was granted direct seeding by FIDE into the final against the winner of the seven-round single elimination Candidates tournament. The psychological and physical advantage gained by Karpov from this decision caused significant controversy, leading to the withdrawal of future World Champion Vladimir Kramnik from the candidates tournament. Anand won the candidates tournament, defeating Michael Adams in the final, and immediately faced a well-rested Karpov for the championship. Despite this tremendous disadvantage for Anand, which he described as being "brought in a coffin" to play Karpov,[28] the regular match ended 3–3, which led to a rapid playoff, which Karpov won 2–0. Karpov thus remained the FIDE champion.

Other results
Anand won three consecutive Advanced Chess tournaments in Leon, Spain, after Garry Kasparov introduced this form of chess in 1998, and is widely recognised as the world's best Advanced Chess player, where humans may consult a computer to aid in their calculation of variations.

His game collection, My Best Games of Chess, was published in the year 1998 and was updated in 2001.

Anand's tournament successes include the Corus chess tournament in 2006 (tied with Veselin Topalov), Dortmund in 2004, and Linares in 2007 and 2008. He has won the annual Melody Amber tournament Blindfold and Rapid Chess Championships in years 1994, 1997, 2003, 2005, and 2006. He is the first player to have won five titles of the Corus chess tournament, succeeded by Magnus Carlsen. He is also the only player to win the blind and rapid sections of the Amber tournament in the same year (twice, in 1997 and 2005). He is the first player to have achieved victories in each of the three big chess supertournaments: Corus (1989, 1998, 2003, 2004, 2006), Linares (1998, 2007, 2008), and Dortmund (1996, 2000, 2004).

In 2007 he won the Grenkeleasing Rapid championship, which he won for the tenth time defeating Armenian GM Levon Aronian.[42] Incidentally, just a few days before Aronian had defeated Anand in the Chess960 final.[43]

In March 2007, Anand won the Linares chess tournament and it was widely believed that he would be ranked world No. 1 in the FIDE Elo rating list for April 2007. However, Anand was placed No. 2 in the initial list released because the Linares result was not included. FIDE subsequently announced that the Linares results would be included after all,[44] pushing Anand to number one in the April 2007 list.[45]

Anand won the Mainz 2008 Supertournament Championship by defeating rising star Magnus Carlsen, earning his eleventh title in that event.[46]

World Chess Championships
1995
Main article: Classical World Chess Championship 1995

In 1995, Anand faced Garry Kasparov for the world championship in a match held at the World Trade Center.
In 1993, the newly formed Professional Chess Association (PCA) held a 54-player, 11-round Swiss-style qualifying tournament in Groningen on 19–30 December, an equivalent to FIDE's Interzonal. Anand scored 7½/11 to finish in a tie for first and secure a berth in the 1994 Candidates' Tournament.[47] In the single-elimination tournament, Anand handily dispatched Oleg Romanishin and Michael Adams in the quarterfinal and semifinal matches, held in New York City and Linares. Facing Gata Kamsky in a 12-game final match held at Las Palmas, Anand lost Game 1 on time in a winning position; however, he recovered with wins in Game 3, 9, and 11 to secure a 6½–4½ victory and a match against reigning champion Garry Kasparov for the World Chess Championship.[48] It was the first Candidates' Tournament victory of Anand's career.

The twenty-game championship match was held from 10 September to 16 October 1995, on the 107th floor of the World Trade Center in New York City. The match started with a then-record eight consecutive draws before Anand broke open the match in Game 9, pressing and eventually breaking through Kasparov's Sicilian Defense with a powerful exchange sacrifice. However, Anand scored just half a point in the next five games, losing twice to Kasparov's Sicilian Dragon defense, and eventually conceded a 10½–7½ loss.[49] Afterwards, Kasparov commented on Anand's psychological approach to the match:

"Anand lost the match in five games, Games 10 to 14. I lost many games in a row to Karpov in the first match I played with him, but I don't think he was that much better. It was a great experience for me. Anand wasn't paying enough attention with his team to the fact that he was playing the World Championship. He has never played such a strong opponent for such a long event. You can't compare his match with Kamsky in April to the match we have played here... I'm criticizing the strategy. He could have played without a fixed strategy and adjusted during the match. The chess preparation was excellent, but there was some psychological advice not appropriate..."[50]

1998
Main article: FIDE World Chess Championship 1998
In a radical departure from previous tournaments, the 1998 world championship was structured as a 100-player knockout tournament, with each round consisting of two-game matches and tie-breaks resolved by rapid and blitz games. Controversially, the defending champion Anatoly Karpov was seeded directly into the final, which was to be held just three days after the conclusion of the three week-long tournament. This format gave Karpov a significant advantage in terms of rest time and preparation;[51] classical world champion Garry Kasparov and Vladimir Kramnik both declined to participate as a result.[52][53] The latter explained his absence bluntly: "Is it fair to expect Sampras to only play one match and defend his Wimbledon title?"[54]

As a result of Kasparov's withdrawal, Anand entered the tournament in Groningen, Netherlands as the #1 seed. After dispatching future FIDE champion Alexander Khalifman in the third round, Anand scored quick victories over Zoltan Almasi, Alexei Shirov, and Boris Gelfand to advance. In the final against ninth-seeded Michael Adams, held on 30 December, both players drew their first four games. A visibly-tired Anand,[55] having played 21 games in 23 days, eventually prevailed in a sudden-death blitz game to secure a 3–2 victory and a match against Karpov for the championship.[56][57]

Immediately following his victory over Adams, Anand arranged a flight with his team to the International Olympic Committee museum in Lausanne, Switzerland to play Karpov in a six-game match for the FIDE world title. Playing on just four hours of pre-match preparation, Anand lost Game 1 after Karpov surprised him with a bold queen sacrifice on the 31st move. He quickly bounced back, however, winning Game 2 in 42 moves from a disadvantaged position after accepting a sharp exchange sacrifice and outplaying Karpov in the resulting endgame. After losing Game 4, Anand entered the final game of the match needing a win to force the match into a playoff. Playing with the white pieces, he opened with the Trompowsky Attack. Karpov defended well until 28...Qd8?, a critical mistake that lost him a piece and the game.[58]

In the first rapid playoff game, Anand secured a significant advantage on the board before a calculation mistake (40...a4?) cost him the game.[59] Karpov then won the second game with the black pieces to seal a 5−3 victory and retain the FIDE world title.[60] Following the match, Anand re-iterated his concerns with the perceived unfairness of the tournament format.

"It was almost as if I had been asked to run a 100-metre sprint after completing a cross country marathon... Karpov waited for the corpse of his challenger to be delivered in a coffin. If anybody else other than Karpov wins, it's a world championship. Otherwise, it's not."[54]

Karpov, meanwhile, questioned Anand's temperament and remarked that he "doesn't have the character" to win big games.[61] For his part, reigning classical champion Kasparov dismissed the match as between "a tired player and an old player".[62]

From 25 November to 27 December 2000, the FIDE World Chess Championships were held as a 100-player single-elimination tournament in New Delhi, India and Tehran, Iran. Following his victory in the 2000 FIDE World Cup, Anand entered the event as the #1 overall seed and one of the favourites to win alongside Veselin Topalov, Boris Gelfand, and Alexei Shirov.[63] Anand decided to join the event after skipping the 1999 edition, due to ongoing negotiations for a title match with reigning classical world champion Garry Kasparov that ultimately fell through.[64] Kasparov and Vladimir Kramnik, who defeated the former in a match for the lineal world title earlier in the year, did not participate in the event. Anand's second and preparation partner for the tournament was Spanish grandmaster Elizbar Ubilava.

Enjoying boisterous home-crowd support, Anand moved through the early rounds with relatively little difficulty, notching quick wins against Viktor Bologan, Smbat Lputian, and Bartłomiej Macieja. In the quarterfinals, Anand was held to four consecutive draws against defending champion Alexander Khalifman before winning a 15-minute tiebreak game to progress.[65] Against Michael Adams in the semi-finals, Anand quickly drew Game 1 and took advantage of a positional blunder by Adams (20...c5?) to win Game 2 in 36 moves with the white pieces.[66] Quick draws in games 3 and 4 then saw Anand through to the final match.

Final position of the match.
The final match, played from 20 to 26 December 2000 in Tehran, Iran, saw Anand face fourth-seeded Alexei Shirov, who was denied a chance to play Kasparov for the world title two years prior. After a draw in Game 1, Anand entered a sharp line in the Ruy Lopez in Game 2, ultimately converting a passed pawn into a winning endgame after placing Shirov in zugzwang on the 41st move. Anand then seized control of the match with a 41-move win in Game 3 after successfully neutralizing a rook sacrifice by Shirov on the 19th move,[67] and sealed victory in the match with another win in Game 4.[68]

Anand's run to his first world championship saw him go unbeaten through the entire tournament, with eight wins and 12 draws. With the win, he became the first world champion from Asia and the first world champion from outside the ex-Soviet Union since Bobby Fischer.[69] In addition to the title of FIDE world champion, Anand received a $528,000 cash prize.[68] Upon his return to India, Anand was awarded the Padma Bhushan by the Indian government in recognition of his world title win. Later, Anand gave his thoughts on his matches against Khalifman and Shirov;

"The tie-breaker against Khalifman was more thrilling, because this was in the knock-out stage. There was a stage when I felt that I was on the verge of being eliminated. We played a series of games one after another. It was touch and go. I could not prepare myself before every game in Delhi because I did not know who was going to be my opponent the next day. So I would prepare for a general game. But I knew that in the final I was playing against Shirov. I knew that he had not been playing well. If he had won six games, he had lost eight. So I knew if I could put him under pressure he would make mistakes. And that is what I did."[70]

Main article: World Chess Championship 2007
The finish of the 2005 World Chess Championship qualified Anand for the 2007 championship, an eight-player double round-robin tournament held in Mexico City from 12 to 30 September 2007. In 2006, Vladimir Kramnik took Topalov's place in the event after his victory over the latter to re-unify the world title.[71] Anand entered the tournament as the world's top-ranked player, and was considered a favourite to win alongside the defending champion Kramnik.[72]

After a Round 1 draw, Anand struck first blood in the tournament, handily defeating Levon Aronian with the black pieces in Round 2.[73] After the fourth round, Anand and Kramnik were tied for the lead with 2½/4 each.[72] In the next three rounds, however, Anand separated himself from the pack with wins over Peter Svidler and Alexander Grischuk, taking the sole lead.[74] He then held the defending champion Kramnik to a draw in Round 10, and extended his lead to 1½ points with a 56-move win over Alexander Morozevich. In Round 13, Anand played precise defense and salvaged a lost rook endgame against Grischuk with the black pieces to narrowly retain his lead,[75] and sealed the championship in the final round with a 20-move draw against Peter Leko. Anand's victorious run in Mexico City saw him pick up four wins and 10 draws, and he ultimately finished as the only undefeated player in the tournament with a 2848 performance rating.[76]

Anand's triumph in Mexico City represented his second world chess championship, and first since the re-unification of the title in 2006. As a result of the win, Anand gained nine rating points to break the 2800 Elo rating barrier for the second time in his career in October 2007.[77] In the post-event press conference, Anand commented on his final game and his feelings on winning the tournament:

"This time there is no rival claimant, so obviously it is a fantastic feeling. You can imagine how I feel. This is something very special for me. I feel that here I played the best. You have to perform at the right moment - it's important that I peaked here. This tournament went like a dream... Yesterday I had to work really hard but today I just remembered Tal's saying that when your hand plays one way and your heart plays another, it never goes well. So I decided to be very solid and just go for the draw."[78]

With the win, Anand became the first undisputed world champion to win the title in a tournament, rather than in matchplay, since Mikhail Botvinnik in 1948. In addition to the world title, Anand received a $390,000 cash prize.[79]

Responding to Anand's win, Garry Kasparov said "A great result for Anand and for chess. Vishy deserved the win in every way and I'm very happy for him. It will not be easy for the younger generation to push him aside... Anand out-prepared Kramnik completely. In this way it reminded me of my match with Kramnik in London 2000. Like I was then, Kramnik may have been very well prepared for this match, but we never saw it."[83] In 2010 Anand donated his gold medal to the charitable organisation "The Foundation" to be auctioned off for the benefit of underprivileged children.[84]

Main article: World Chess Championship 2010
Before the World Chess Championship 2010 match with Veselin Topalov, Anand, who had been booked on the flight Frankfurt–Sofia on 16 April, was stranded due to the cancellation of all flights following the volcano ash cloud from Eyjafjallajökull. Anand asked for a three-day postponement, which the Bulgarian organisers refused on 19 April. Anand eventually reached Sofia on 20 April, after a 40-hour road journey.[85] Consequently, the first game was delayed by one day.[86]

The match consisted of 12 games. In Game 1, Topalov quickly defeated Anand in 30 moves, utilizing a very sharp line of attack that broke through Anand's Grunfeld Defence. It was revealed afterwards that Topalov had found the line during his opening preparation, with the help of a powerful supercomputer loaned to him by Bulgaria's Defense Department.[87] Anand quickly responded with a win in Game 2, employing a novelty out of the Catalan Opening that was not easily recognized by computers at the time (15. Qa3!?, followed by 16. bxa3!). Anand would win again with the Catalan in Game 4, only to drop Game 8 and leave the score level once again.[88] After 11 games the score was tied at 5½–5½. Anand won game 12 on the Black side of a Queen's Gambit Declined to win the game and the match. Topalov chose to accept a pawn sacrifice by Anand, hoping to force a result and avoid a rapid chess tiebreak round. But after Topalov's dubious 31st and 32nd moves, Anand used the sacrifice to obtain a strong attack against Topalov's relatively exposed king. Topalov subsequently resigned, allowing Anand to retain the World Championship.

Anand won the double round-robin FIDE Candidates tournament at Khanty-Mansiysk (13–30 March) and earned a world championship rematch with Magnus Carlsen. Anand went through the tournament undefeated, winning his first-round game against Levon Aronian, his third-round game against Shakhriyar Mamedyarov, and his ninth-round game against Veselin Topalov.[92] He drew all his other games, including his twelfth-round game against Dmitry Andreikin, where Anand agreed to a draw in a complex, but winning position.[93] He faced Carlsen in the world championship match in Sochi, Russia, in November.[94] Carlsen won the match 6.5 to 4.5 after eleven of twelve scheduled games.

FIDE World Rapid Chess Champion 2003
In October 2003, the governing body of chess, FIDE, organised a rapid time control tournament in Cap d'Agde[95][96] and billed it as the World Rapid Chess Championship. Each player had 25 minutes at the start of the game, with an additional ten seconds after each move. Anand won this event ahead of ten of the other top twelve players in the world, beating Kramnik in the final. His main recent titles in this category are at: Corsica (six years in a row from 1999 through 2005), Chess Classic (nine years in a row from 2000 through 2008), Leon 2005, Eurotel 2002, Fujitsu Giants 2002 and the Melody Amber (five times, and he won the rapid portion of Melody Amber seven times). In the Melody Amber 2007, Anand did not lose a single game in the rapid section, and scored 8½/11, two more than the runners-up, for a performance rating in the rapid section of 2939.[97] In most tournament time control games that Anand plays, he has more time left than his opponent at the end of the game. He lost on time in one game, to Gata Kamsky. Otherwise, he took advantage of the rule allowing players in time trouble to use dashes instead of the move notation during the last four minutes only once, in the game Anand versus Svidler at the MTel Masters 2006.[98]

FIDE World Rapid Chess Champion 2017
Anand won the 2017 World Rapid Chess Championship by defeating Vladimir Fedoseev 2–0 in the final tiebreak after he, Fedoseev and Ian Nepomniachtchi tied for first with 10.5/15 points.[99] He won the tournament ahead of reigning Classical World Champion Magnus Carlsen and this was his first victory in a world championship since losing the classical championship to Carlsen in 2013.

Anand declined to participate in the Paris Rapid and Blitz tournament, meaning his results in Leuven, the Sinquefield Cup and the London Chess Classic would count toward the overall standings. Additionally Anand qualified for the 2016 World Chess Championship Candidates tournament by virtue of losing the 2014 World Chess Championship match.

Gibraltar Chess Open: In 2016, Anand played in the Gibraltar open, his first open in 23 years. Anand finished with 5 wins, 2 losses and 3 draws. The losses were against Réunion-born Adrien Demuth and Hungarian talent Benjámin Gledura. Anand's classical rating dropped 21.9 points.

This rapid section of the tournament was a played with a modified time control of 40 minutes for the game with 10 additional seconds per move. The other 5 players of the tournament included Hikaru Nakamura, Levon Aronian, Vladimir Kramnik, Anish Giri, and Alexei Shirov. Anand scored victories over Aronian and Giri in the first two games of the Rapid tournament. He eventually tied for first with Nakamura with 10.5 points, after Nakamura won the final blitz game against Aronian; however Nakamura won the tournament on a Sonneborn-Berger tiebreaker.[128]

Anand qualified by virtue of losing the 2014 World Chess Championship match against Magnus Carlsen. Finally Levon Aronian qualified as the organizers' Wild Card.

Anand had the unique distinction of the only player to have beaten the winner Karjakin in the 2016 Candidates Tournament.

Rating
In the April 2007 FIDE Elo rating list, Anand was ranked first in the world for the first time,[144] and (as of July 2008) he held the number one spot in all ratings lists but one since then until July 2008, the exception being the January 2008 list, where he was rated No. 2 behind Vladimir Kramnik (equal rating, but Kramnik held the No. 1 spot due to more games played).[145] He dropped to No. 5 in the October 2008 list, the first time he had been outside the top 3 since July 1996.[146]

In 2010, Anand announced that he would expand his tournament schedule, beginning in late 2010, in an effort to regain the world number one ranking from Magnus Carlsen.[147][148] He achieved that goal on 1 November 2010 list with a rating of 2804, two points ahead of Magnus Carlsen,[149] but was once again overtaken by Carlsen in July 2011.

Assessment
Lubomir Kavalek describes Anand as the most versatile world champion ever, pointing out that Anand is the only player to have won the world chess championship in tournament, match, and knockout format, as well as rapid time controls.[150]

In an interview in 2011, Kramnik said about Anand: "I always considered him to be a colossal talent, one of the greatest in the whole history of chess"; and "I think that in terms of play Anand is in no way weaker than Kasparov but he's simply a little lazy, relaxed and only focuses on matches. In the last 5–6 years he's made a qualitative leap that's made it possible to consider him one of the great chess players."[151] In an interview in 2020, Kramnik, while talking about his World Chess Championship match against Anand in 2008, mentioned: "Vishy is such a great player and he was in a fantastic form. He was such a powerful force that I do not know who could have stopped him then. Even Kasparov could not have managed it."[152]

FIDE President Kirsan Ilyumzhinov commented that Anand's victory in the 2014 Candidates Tournament "...proved that he is one of the strongest and greatest players of modern times".[153]

In an interview in 2014 Alexander Grischuk said about Anand: "I have to say that of all the players I've played against Anand has personally struck me as the strongest, of course after Kasparov."[154]

An interview with Economic Times, Anand says that "experimentation is important in cricket and chess". [155]
